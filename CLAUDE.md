# UI

- By default use the mac_ui for flutter library for widgets, colors and fonts. You can find more information about the mac_ui in the [mac_ui repo summary](docs/mac_ui.txt).

# State Management

- For simple state handling , local state in a stateful wdiget is ok, for anything more complex, extract out into a cubit. Cubits are tested in the test foler.
