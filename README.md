## What Sets This Apart

**Pinboard Wizard isn't just another bookmark manager.** It's designed for users who:

### üéØ **Want Curated Bookmark Collections**

Traditional bookmark managers treat all bookmarks equally. We hack Pinboard's tagging system to create a **pin-based curation system**:

- **Pin with categories**: find your most important bookmarks by pinning them, optionally under a category like `pin:work`, `pin:reading`, `pin:tools`

### ü§ñ **Want AI-Enhanced Bookmarks (Cost-Controlled)**

Skip expensive AI subscription services. Bring your own OpenAI API key and pay only for what you use:

- **Automatic metadata**: AI generates titles, descriptions, and tags from URLs
- **Your costs, your control**: Usually costs pennies per month
- **No vendor lock-in**: Your data stays in Pinboard, AI is optional

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Want Secure Cloud Backup Options**

Your bookmarks are precious. Keep them safe with AWS S3 integration:

- **Direct S3 backup**: Export to your own AWS bucket
- **Full control**: You own your data and backup location
- **Disaster recovery**: Import from S3 if needed

**Perfect for**: Developers and power users.

## Features

#### How Pin Categories Work

The pin categorization system transforms Pinboard's simple tagging into a powerful curation tool:

**Basic Pinning:**

- Tag with `pin` ‚Üí Appears in "General" section
- Simple one-click pinning from bookmark list

**Categorized Pinning:**

- Tag with `pin:work` ‚Üí Creates "Work" category
- Tag with `pin:work-projects` ‚Üí Creates "Work Projects" category
- Tag with `pin:reading-list` ‚Üí Creates "Reading List" category

**Smart Features:**

- **Dynamic categories**: Categories appear automatically as you create them
- **Existing category suggestions**: Reuse categories with one click
- **Intelligent formatting**: Hyphens become spaces, proper capitalization
- **Grouped display**: Pinned page shows bookmarks organized by category
- **Easy management**: Update categories or remove pins entirely

### ü§ñ **AI Integration** (Bring Your Own Key)

- **Cost-effective AI**: Use your own OpenAI API key (typically pennies/month)
- **Smart metadata extraction**: Auto-generate titles, descriptions, tags from URLs
- **Content analysis**: AI reads page content for intelligent suggestions
- **No subscriptions**: Pay only for what you use, when you use it

### ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard Shortcuts**
