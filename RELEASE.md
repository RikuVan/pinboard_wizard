     ```

4. **Publish release** (don't check "pre-release" for stable releases)

### 3. Automated Build Process

Once you publish the release, GitHub Actions will automatically:

1. **Build the macOS app** in release mode
2. **Create tarball** with proper naming: `pinboard-wizard-v1.2.0-macos.tar.gz`
3. **Calculate SHA256** hash for verification
4. **Upload tarball** as release asset
5. **Update release notes** with download and installation instructions

### 4. Manual Installation Testing

Download and test the release tarball:

```bash
# Download the tarball
curl -L https://github.com/richardvancamp/pinboard_wizard/releases/download/v1.2.0/pinboard-wizard-v1.2.0-macos.tar.gz -o pinboard-wizard.tar.gz

# Extract and test
tar -xzf pinboard-wizard.tar.gz
open "Pinboard Wizard.app"
```

## Post-Release Tasks

- [ ] Test manual installation from tarball
- [ ] Verify app launches correctly from Applications
- [ ] Test that app displays as "Pinboard Wizard" in system UI
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Announce release on relevant channels

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails in GitHub Actions

1. Check the Actions tab for error details
2. Common issues:
   - **Code signing**: Verify automatic signing is enabled
   - **Dependencies**: Check if any new dependencies need setup
   - **Tests failing**: Fix tests before releasing

### SHA256 Verification Issues

1. **Wrong SHA256**: Download the tarball and recalculate:

   ```bash
   shasum -a 256 pinboard-wizard-v1.2.0-macos.tar.gz
   ```

2. **Installation verification**: Test locally:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf pinboard-wizard-v1.2.0-macos.tar.gz
   mv "Pinboard Wizard.app" /Applications/
   open -a "Pinboard Wizard"
   ```

### App Won't Launch After Install

1. Check codesigning: `codesign -dv "Pinboard Wizard.app"`
2. Verify entitlements match build configuration
3. Test with Gatekeeper: System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy

## Version Numbering

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0): Breaking changes, major new features
- **Minor** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1): Bug fixes, backward compatible

Flutter build numbers should increment with each release:

- `1.0.0+1` ‚Üí `1.0.1+2` ‚Üí `1.1.0+3` ‚Üí etc.

## Release Checklist Template

Copy this for each release:

```markdown
